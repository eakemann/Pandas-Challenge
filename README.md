## Takeaways

Based on the extracted Heroes of PyMoli data, we are able to observe several finds:

1)	Out of 780 item purchases with an average price of $3.05, 25% of those purchases were made by players who purchased more than one item.
2)	84% of the games 576 unique players are male, while 14% (or 81 players) are female, and 2% (or 11 players either have another gender identity or chose not to disclose their gender identity.
3)	Even though there were less females playing, their purchasing value was higher in terms of the average price paid for items, where, 113 purchases made by females accounted for an average purchase price of $3.20 per item, whereas the 652 male purchases suggest possibly buying less expensive items (though more volume), only spending around $3.02 per item. The Other/Non-Disclosed group spent the most of all per item spending an average of $3.35 per item purchased.  The total volume per gender however was $361.94 for females, $1,967.64 for males, and $50.19 for Other/Non Disclosed genders for a total purchase volume of $2,379.77.

5)	The highest spenders per item however are also among the oldest players (35-39, or 5.4% of players) where they spend $3.60 per item.  After that however, the kids <10 spend the most with an average of $3.35 per item spent (I hope their parents are aware they’re spending their money on gaming items!).
